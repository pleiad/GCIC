(** This module specifies global declarations. 
    It follows Coq's example a bit (https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/kernel/declarations.ml)    

    For now we are considering a global declaration to be simply a term and its
    type. 
    We are going for the simplest solution for the moment, but global declarations 
    could have their own type, etc.
